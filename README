Usage:
./iss boardnum [numberofthreads] [chunksize]

boardnum is the number of the board to be solved.
numberofthreads is the number of threads to start. This value should probably not be higher than the amount of cores available on the machine. Default: 4.
chunksize is an optimization parameter that describes the chunksize each thread should grab at the start of each iteration. Default: 300
